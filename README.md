# Task-Manager
This is an app I made on Sketchware. It helped me prioritize my day to day task which made me feel like I was productive. 
I've stopped working on this for the past few months now cuz I'm learning to use Android Studio. Once I'm done with that I'll redo this project on Android Studio as a recap of what I learned and then continue builing this app to meet more of my needs.
